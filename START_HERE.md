## 🚀 How It Works

### Game Flow
```
1. Start game
   ↓
2. Select mode (PvP or PvAI)
   ↓
3. If PvAI, select difficulty
   ↓
4. Player makes move (WHITE)
   ↓
5. AI analyzes position (BLACK) - background thread
   ↓
6. AI makes move
   ↓
7. Check for check/mate/stalemate
   ↓
8. Repeat from step 4
```

### AI Algorithm
The AI uses **Minimax with alpha-beta pruning**:
- Evaluates positions recursively
- Prunes branches that won't affect result
- Adjustable search depth (1-5)
- Scores positions based on piece values

---

## 🎓 Learning Resources

### Understanding the AI
1. Read **[AI_GUIDE.md](AI_GUIDE.md)** for complete documentation
2. Check **[IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md](IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)** for technical details
3. Review **[.github/copilot-instructions.md](.github/copilot-instructions.md)** for architecture

### Playing Better
1. Read **[QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md)** for game rules
2. Learn chess basics (piece movements, tactics)
3. Start with lower difficulty levels
4. Gradually increase difficulty as you improve

### Improving the AI
1. See **[AI_GUIDE.md](AI_GUIDE.md)** section "Improving AI Strength"
2. Options include:
   - Increasing search depth
   - Adding opening books
   - Improving position evaluation
   - Implementing transposition tables

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Game won't start
```bash
# Recompile everything
javac -d bin -sourcepath src src\main\*.java src\piece\*.java src\ai\*.java
java -cp bin main.Main
```

### AI is too slow
- Use lower difficulty level (1-3)
- Reduce search depth in `src/ai/ChessAI.java`

### AI makes bad moves
- Try higher difficulty level
- Check that AI is not in "thinking" state

### Pieces don't display
- Ensure `res/piece/` directory exists
- Check PNG file names are correct

See **[QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md)** for more troubleshooting.
